### Prompting Basics

**Definition:**\
Prompting is the process of crafting requests to guide a language model's output. It involves formulating questions, instructions, or statements that give the model enough contextual information to rearange your input and its internal knowledge into a satisfactory output. 

Effective prompting can significantly improve the quality and relevance of a model's responses and we'll be going over a few of those techniques.

**Why Prompt Engineering Matters:**\
AI models aren't magic. You always have the best chance of getting a useful response when you give clear, specific, and contextual prompts. 

If your question aligns with the model's training data, you're more likely to get an answer that the model has seen before, and relates back to your question.

#### Key Principles of Effective Prompting
- **Clarity**: Use clear and unambiguous language. Avoid jargon or complex phrasing that may confuse the model.
- **Specificity**: Be specific about what you want. Vague prompts can lead to vague responses.
- **Context**: Provide sufficient context to help the model understand the task. This can include background information or examples.
- **Examples**: Examples help guide the model to produce responses that resonate with your expectations.
