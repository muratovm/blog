### ChatGPT

>[!Context]
> I've been using ChatGPT since it came out in `late 2022`. I first caught the wave of people excited about what seemed like a limited beta release of a language model that was surprisingly good at generating coherent text. When it first release I would give it ridiculous premises to write stories about, and it would do so without fail. I had a great time reading these stories with friends and we'd all laugh about how funny and interesting they were. I had very little foresight as to how much things would change after that. 

### Copilot

>[!Context]
> Copilot was the first code specific language model I tried and I've been using it ever since. It works great as a basic autocomplete to help bubble up related functionality that I can choose to add in my project. For planning out a software project I use other language models with reasoning advanced functions.
