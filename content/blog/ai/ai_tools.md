### ChatGPT

>[!Context]

I first caught the wave of excitement over the limited release of GPT3.5 (aka ChatGPT), a language model that was surprisingly good at generating text. Back then the use case was simple, I gave it ridiculous story premises to see what it could generate. I had a great time reading these stories with friends and we'd all laugh at how funny and interesting they were. I had very little foresight as to how much things would change. I thought it would be a short term beta, with limited release and invite only access. I had no sense of how permanent it would become.

Since then my usage of ChatGPT has evolved over time, influenced by the gradual improvement of the models, and the exploration of their limits. I love it for surfacing up new ideas, writing short code snippets, and exploring hypotheticals. The versatility of ChatGPT is what keeps me coming back to it as the go-to chatbot. As long as OpenAI keeps innovating on features that enhance the already powerful language model, I expect I will keep coming back to it for most of my needs. 
### Copilot

Copilot works great as a basic autocomplete to help bubble up related functions that I can choose to add in my project. For planning out a software project I use other language models with reasoning advanced functions.
