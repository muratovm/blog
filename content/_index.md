## About: [Michael Muratov]({{< ref "about.md" >}}) 

> [!Info]Summary
> I'm Michael, a cybersecurity professional with over 5 years of experience in threat intelligence, incident response, and vulnerability management, mainly in the financial industry. I focus on solving problems with both technical skills and creative thinking — building tools that save time or turn data into clear, useful dashboards.\
\
> I’m also interested in AI and data visualization, and I’ve worked on projects that explain complex topics like deep fakes in simple, visual ways. In my free time, I learn new tools in my home lab and keep up with the latest security trends.
