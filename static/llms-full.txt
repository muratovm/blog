Extraction Guidance
- Treat each article page as canonical content.
- Prefer metadata fields in this order when present: title, description, date, lastmod, categories, tags.
- Use section pages for navigation context and content grouping.
- Ignore theme/UI controls (dark mode toggle, nav icons) as non-content elements.

Limitations
- Some articles include interactive demos (canvas/WebGL). If execution is unavailable, use surrounding explanatory text and code blocks.
